            When users report password reset issues, follow this systematic approach:
            
            1. **Email Delivery Issues**:
               - Check if reset emails are going to spam/junk folder
               - Verify email address spelling and domain
               - Check our email sending logs for delivery status
               - Add our domain to their email whitelist
            
            2. **Account Status Verification**:
               - Ensure account is not locked or suspended
               - Check if account exists in our system
               - Verify account is properly activated
            
            3. **Reset Link Problems**:
               - Reset links expire after 24 hours
               - Links are single-use only
               - Clear browser cache and cookies
               - Try different browser or incognito mode
            
            4. **Urgent Cases**:
               - Use admin panel to manually reset password
               - Send temporary password via secure channel
               - Schedule follow-up to ensure resolution
            
            5. **Prevention**:
               - Educate users about password requirements
               - Suggest using password managers
               - Enable two-factor authentication

            Payment processing errors can have multiple causes. Here's how to diagnose and resolve them:
            
            1. **Card Validation Issues**:
               - Verify card number, expiry date, and CVV
               - Check if card supports online transactions
               - Confirm billing address matches card details
               - Try different payment method if available
            
            2. **Bank-Side Restrictions**:
               - Contact customer's bank to check for holds
               - Verify international transaction permissions
               - Check for daily/monthly spending limits
               - Confirm account has sufficient funds
            
            3. **Our System Issues**:
               - Check payment gateway status dashboard
               - Verify API credentials are current
               - Review recent system updates or changes
               - Check for rate limiting or fraud detection triggers
            
            4. **Customer Account Issues**:
               - Verify account is in good standing
               - Check for any billing disputes or chargebacks
               - Confirm account billing settings
               - Review payment history for patterns
            
            5. **Immediate Solutions**:
               - Process manual payment if urgent
               - Set up payment plan if appropriate
               - Apply temporary service extension
               - Escalate to billing specialist if needed

            API 403 Forbidden errors indicate authentication or permission issues. Follow this diagnostic approach:
            
            1. **API Key Verification**:
               - Confirm API key is correct and hasn't expired
               - Check key permissions and scopes
               - Verify key is being sent in correct header format
               - Test with a fresh API key if needed
            
            2. **Authentication Headers**:
               - Ensure Authorization header is properly formatted
               - Check for extra spaces or special characters
               - Verify bearer token format if applicable
               - Test authentication with API testing tools
            
            3. **Rate Limiting**:
               - Check if customer has exceeded rate limits
               - Review API usage patterns and spikes
               - Implement proper retry logic with backoff
               - Consider upgrading API plan if needed
            
            4. **IP Whitelisting**:
               - Verify source IP is whitelisted if required
               - Check for recent IP address changes
               - Update whitelist if customer changed infrastructure
               - Consider using dynamic IP solutions
            
            5. **Permission Levels**:
               - Confirm API key has required permissions
               - Check if endpoint requires special access
               - Verify account tier supports requested features
               - Review recent permission changes
